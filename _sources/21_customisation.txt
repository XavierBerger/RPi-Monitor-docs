Customisation
=============

Friends
-------

Add "friends" links **RPi-Monitor** running on different platform together.

A friend is simply another computer running **RPi-Monitor**. Configuring friends 
will add a drop down list on the right of the top menu with a links to 
**RPi-Monitor** sitting on the other computer.

In ``/etc/rpimonitord/data.conf``, each friend is identified by an ``id`` and is 
described by 2 parameters: ``<name>`` and ``<link>``.

.. seealso:: Detaiiled `Friends definition  <13_web.html#friends>`_

Here is an example of configuration for 3 friends:

::

  web.friends.1.name=Raspberry Pi 
  web.friends.1.link=http://192.168.0.123/ 
  web.friends.2.name=Shuttle 
  web.friends.2.link=http://192.168.0.2/ 
  web.friends.3.name=Laptop 
  web.friends.3.link=http://192.168.0.38/

Multiple pages
--------------

This version of RPi-Monitor introduce the notion of pages. Adding a new page 
can be done in configuration file by setting the parameter named ``<page id>``.
RPi-Monitor will automatically interpret this new id and create the associated 
page. The new page will be accessible by a drop down menu as shown in the 
screenshot bellow.

Labels
------

The goal of this function is to add a colored text reflecting the status of a service.

Label funtion overview
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The function Label is designed to write a text highligted by a color.

::

    Label(value, condition, text, level) 

This function determine if the label has to be displayed ot not base on a value
 (extracted by **RPi-Monitor**) and a condition. The label contains a text to 
 be displayed and a level. 6 levels of labels are available with 6 differences colors:

  :align: center

How to use it?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The file ``/etc/rpimonitor/template/services.conf`` is showing an example of Label usage.

In this example, we monitor if the service ``ssh`` is listening on port ``22`` and display a 
label ``OK`` if yes or a label ``KO`` if not.

We do the same for **RPi-Monitor** on port ``8888`` and for ``nginx`` on port ``80`` and ``443``.

How does it work?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Information is extracted from the command ``netstat``.

The regular expression will return the port number if a service is listening 
on this port or nothing if no service is listenning on this port.

Note: these regular expression may be optimised to return more accurrate result.


The results are accessible into javascript from the variable data. This 
variable is passed to the Label function as value.

For ssh, the condition is ``"==22"`` to check if the value is equal to 
``22`` or ``"!=22"`` to check if the value is different form 22. As only one of 
the condition will be ``true``, only one label will be displayed.

Other ports checking are using the same technic.

Example of Label function used to show server status

As you see, the usage of this new function is quite easy. You can now 
imagine how to use it for your own needs.




Customise WEB page header
-------------------------

This new function allow to define a custom logo, custome title and add the 
hostname of the machine int the title of the browser.

Here are the configuration lines used by default:

  web.page.icon='img/avatar.png'
  web.page.menutitle='XB-Monitor  <sub>('+data.hostname+')</sub>'
  web.page.pagetitle='XB-Monitor ('+data.hostname+')'

data.hostname is a value automatically extracted by RPi-Monitor. It is not 
needed to add a configuration to do such a thing.

The file avatar.png has been added into /usr/share/rpimonitor/web/img/.

Here is the result:



Inside Firefox title bar and tab, the title has been changed and hostmane 
has been added between parentheses.
Inside RPi-Monitor menu bar, le logo and the title have been changed and 
hostmane has been added between parentheses. 

JustGageBar
-----------

A new widget is now available to display information in status page. Justgage is a handy JavaScript plugin for generating and animating nice & clean gauges. It is based on Raphaël library for vector drawing, so it’s completely resolution independent and self-adjusting.

  JustGageBar(title, label,min, value, max, width, height, levelColors, warning, critical)
 
To see how justgage behave, you can activate the configuration file example.justgage.conf (Ref example explaination and screenshot upper).

The detail of function usage is available into the manpage:


  man rpimonitord.conf

Visibility
----------

A new parameter can be used in configuration file defining a visibility of a row:

  web.status.<page id>.content.<row id>.visibility=<visibility formula>

<visibility formula> should be a valid javascript formula returning
          0: to hide the row
          anything else but 0: show the row
