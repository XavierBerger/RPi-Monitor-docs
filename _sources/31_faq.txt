Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

RPi-Monitor's graphs are not clean and frequently drop down to zero as in 
screenshot bellow. How can I have a clean curve?

  **RPi-Monitor** is periodically getting data from program of files. 
  If the program is not answering or if the file is empty, the value is unknown. 
  This unknown value will be drawn as a zero in graphs. If, as in the upper 
  example, the program reading the sensor is giving reliable values, it is 
  advised to create a script writing the temperature result into a file and to 
  configure **RPi-Monitor** to read this file. In this case, if the file is not 
  updated, the previous value will be read and drawn in graphs.

RPi-Monitor's web interface is not working, I've only white pages?
  **RPi-Monitor** requires HTML5 local storage and cookies to work properly. 
  You should check that these both functionalities are activated into your browser and check that no plug-ins is blocking them.

Is RPi-Monitor supporting distribution XXX?
  Can you make **RPi-Monitor** compatible with distribution XXX?

RPi-Monitor was developed on Raspbian. This distribution is then fully supported.
  I will not officially support any other distribution but you will find in 
  github repository some configuration files that may help you to configure 
  **RPi-Monitor** on your system.
  Remember, **RPi-Monitor** is highly configurable and should be able to run on 
  every system able to run perl. Have a look to **RPi-Monitor** articles for examples.

I have a problems running rpimonitord:  failed "Can't locate _______.pm  in @INC ...
  The installation is not done properly. You should read again the installation 
  procedure and pay attention to the dependencies.

I would like to use my favorite web server instead of the one embedded into RPi-Monitor. Is it possible?
  Yes, this is possible but not recommended. **RPi-Monitor** embedded web server is 
  optimized to reduce the usage of the SDCard, reduce the resources used into 
  the system. The Web interface is requiring some specific feature that can only 
  be delivered by **RPi-Monitor** embedded web server (like empty.rrd file generation 
  ensuring a clean display of graphs).

Can you add login/password and authentication to RPI-Monitor web interface?
  No. I'll never add such a feature to **RPi-Monitor**. Why? Just because it is 
  something complex to do in a clean and fully secured way. Some software are 
  already design to do the job and they do it well. Refer to this article if 
  you need such a feature.

How can I do customize RPi-Monitor, change data extracted, add images, change texts...
  In **RPi-Monitor** almost everything is configurable. This can be done by 
  configuration file. Have a look to **RPi-Monitor** articles for examples.

I tried to install RPi-Monitor into an OS not officially supported and some data are missing. How can I fix it?
  As I said previously, in **RPi-Monitor** almost everything is configurable. You 
  should find the command to execute or the file to read to get the missing 
  value directly in the shell. Once the command is found you will need to 
  update the configuration file. Have a look to **RPi-Monitor** articles for 
  examples (have a look to the command rpimonitord -i).

I would like to monitor a cluster of raspberries with your tool. Is there a way to gather the whole data in one node? 
  It could have any answer to such a question. One possibility would be to use 
  ssh and configure **RPi-Monitor** to execute commands on ech remote nodes of 
  your cluster and process the data locally.
  To do so, you should create one configuration file per node to monitor and 
  use all of them in RPi-Monitor. Using pages feature could be very usefull. 
  You can use the main page to display some consolidate data in addition to one 
  page per cluster.
  This question is interresting and I'll think about writing one article about 
  this subjet.

I found a bug into RPi-Monitor. How can I share my discovery?
  You should open an issue in github and describe you problem and how to reproduce it.

Download bandwidth is shown as negative values. It's bug or feature?
  This is a feature :-). But, remember, everything is customizable in **RPI-Monitor**...

I want to create a package for my favorite distribution which is not supported by defalut. How can I contribute to this project?
  **RPi-Monitor** source code is hosted in github. The file PACKAGING.md should 
  catch your interest.

I've some issue with my installation or customization of RPi-Monitor and I want to reinstall it from scratch. How can I do it?
  Here is the instruction to reinstall **RPi-Monitor** from scratch:
  First, uninstall **RPi-Monitor** with the following command:
  ::
  
    apt-get purge rpimonitor
    rm -fr /etc/rpimonitor
    rm -fr /usr/share/rpimonitor

  Then reinstall by following the instruction gathered in this page.


Some data are not extracting correctly at boot but when I restart rpimonotird everything becomes OK until I reboot. How can I fix thi issue?
  If you reach such situation, you certainly configure your source using a 
  command whitout the full path. For example ``gettemp.sh`` instead of 
  ``/usr/bin/gettemp.sh``.The first command is working in your shell because the 
  variable $PATH is set and the executable is reachable (that why it work when 
  you restart rpimonitord).
  When you start your computer, the $PATH variable is not set so ``gettemp.sh`` 
  will not work. The solution is to use the full path command ``/usr/bin/gettemp.sh`` 

I just update my distribution and RPi-Monitor is still saying that packages required to be updated. Why?
  Every night at 3h10, a script is executed to update the package update 
  information displayed in **RPi-Monitor**. If you want to update this information 
  immediately, you can execute this script manually:  ``/usr/share/rpimonitor/scripts/updatePackagesStatus.pl``

I required better resolutions of the reading provided by the RPI monitor. Can we increase the frequency with which the RPI monitor collects the data?
  Yes, since version 2.11, it is possible to define the RRD structure per data 
  extracted. Refer to documentation and man page to know how use this 
  advanced feature.
